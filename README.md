# full-stack-restaurant-application

## This is my capstone project for my MIT Emeritus project
This is the first full stack website I have built using the MERN stack. It combines both a front and and backend using next.js, mongodb, strapi, react, bootstrap, and integrates stripe as a payment processor. I plan to refactor this over time to add more functionality to various aspects such as making it more of a good looking webpage (less blocky) as well as adding some better functionality in the sign in (google login, etc). 

### How to Install and Run
1. Fork this repo to your account
2. Download the files needed to run your code
3. Run npm install in the front end code main branch
4. Then run npm run dev to see it boot up the front end on your localhost:3000
5. CD to the backend folder
6. Run npm install again in your terminal
7. Then run npm run build to build your strapi webpack
8. Then npm run develop to get the strapi db up and running. 
9. from there, navigate to localhost:1337/admin and add your restaurnats and dishes to replicate the same checkout data.
